Part B analysis was developed explicitly in python. In order to run it, open a cmd and type the below:

Cd <Code Location Path>
Python <Code Name > <Location Path of orders_jan21 csv file>

Once you execute the command, you will see the results in the console.

Alternatively, you can comment out line 10 and pass the Location Path of orders_jan21 csv file replacing sys.argv[1] in line 11. 
#Script=sys.argv[0]
DataSet=<Location of the orders_jan21 csv file>

Then execute the code using an IDE of your choise.
Please also note that some parts of the analysis have been commented out e.g. plots, but you can uncomment them in case you want to execute them separately.
